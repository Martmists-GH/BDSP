# Starlight - BDSP 

This repository contains a fork of [Starlight](https://github.com/shadowninja108/Starlight), a switch modding template,
based on [Dialga](https://github.com/CraftyBoss/Dialga). 

It has been modified to use CMake and supports importing in CLion.
Additionally, it has tasks to easily integrate with [SimpleModManager](https://github.com/nadrino/SimpleModManager),
as well as export to common emulators.

## Prerequisites

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 
- Python 3
- The [Keystone-Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) Python Module

## Building

The build has only been tested on Arch Linux and WSL, and is not designed for Windows.

Simply run:
```
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain.cmake  # Configure tasks
$ make release_atmosphere                               # build tree
$ make zip_atmosphere                                   # export as zip
$ make send_atmosphere                                  # optional: send to switch using ftp 
```

To use SimpleModManager:
```
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain.cmake  # Configure tasks
$ make release_modmanager                               # build tree
$ make zip_modmanager                                   # export as zip
$ make send_modmanager                                  # optional: send to switch using ftp 
```

There's also targets for Ryujinx and Yuzu (without the send_ target).

## Installing (Atmosph√®re)

After a successful build, simply transfer the files located inside `starlight_patch_(Version Number)` to the root of your switch's SD card.
